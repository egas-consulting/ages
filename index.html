              Over the past thirty years, Romania has undergone some of the most profound and rapid transformations 
              in its modern history. These changes encompass a wide range of areas, including economics, politics, technology, 
              lifestyle, and social and financial behaviors. As a result, the country is now, in many ways, unrecognizable 
              from its previous form, with both positive and negative outcomes.

              Back in the day, only a few people had a positive emotional connection to the post-communist Romania, 
              and many couldn't comprehend the full scale of the significant changes that would take place in 
              the subsequent years. Likewise, in contemporary times, Romanians are struggling to imagine how 
              their lives would have turned out if they were of the same age during the turbulent years that followed 1989.

              Throughout the three decades of transition, not only have we, citizens of a country striving 
              to catch up with the West, changed. The world around us has also changed at a dizzying pace. 
              All these transformations are reflected in the most intimate aspects of our daily lives. 
              They can be seen even from one generation of Romanians to another.

              In this interactive story, you can do a simple exercise. You select the age category you belong to 
              and you can see how your life would have looked statistically speaking if you had been that age in 1990. 
              You can see the evolution of eight indicators for ten age groups, which show you how 
              life choices have changed for women and men over three decades. The indicators are compared by referring 
              to the population of the age group, not the general population of the country, in order to see the granularity 
              of the evolution. In other words, how many people out of 1000 of the same age and gender are: married, divorced, 
              have children, are unemployed, etc. See the description of the indicators

              The age at which young adults tie the knot has significantly increased. In 1990, the average age for girls 
              to get married was 22 years, but presently, it is 28.3 years. Similarly, boys who, 
              in 1990, married at 25 years old now wait until they are 31.6 years old to get married.

              Nowadays, women and men alike are opting to become parents after turning 30 years old. 
              In comparison to the 90s, the number of women giving birth before the age of 30 has reduced by half.

              The young generation born at the start of the third millennium has grown up amidst the most 
              significant technological advancements, while those who were of the same age in 1990 witnessed 
              the early years of democracy during their adolescent years. Both generations experienced swift 
              transformations in their country, society, and the world during their adolescence and the 
              initial stages of adulthood.

              Back in 1990, if you were a teenage girl, there was a strong possibility of getting married 
              by the age of 20, with nearly 30% of marriages involving wives under the age of 20. 
              However, boys didn't marry at such an early age. After three decades, there has been a 
              considerable transformation, with only 5% of marriages in a year having wives under the age of 20.

              Three decades ago, women tended to become mothers at a relatively young age, but now, 
              it's common for children to be born later in a couple's life. Despite the 30-year gap, 
              Romania continues to face an issue concerning underage mothers. In 1990, approximately 
              10% to 15% of children born in the country were from underage mothers.

            <p>
              If for boys under the age of 20 the divorce rate has remained very low, 
              for girls it has decreased compared to 1990.

              There has been a rise in the number of boys and girls under the age of 20 enrolling in college 
              immediately after completing high school. The increase for girls has been more significant, 
              with the number of female students rising from 37 to 99 per 1000 girls in this age group. 
              This change can be attributed to a more open society, the postponement of family plans, and 
              young Romanian women's growing focus on pursuing higher education and career prospects.

              In 1996, the unemployment rate in this age group was nearly 24% for boys and 33% for girls. 
              The most spectacular difference between the current unemployment rate and that of the 1990s

              Compared to the 90s, the rate of young people in this age group who permanently leave the 
              country has increased fourfold. They are those who either choose to study abroad or 
              leave for work abroad after turning 18. It is also a consequence of the much greater 
              freedom of movement and opportunity that young Romanians enjoy, compared to those of 
              their age immediately after the Revolution.

              high school to college or from college to the job market.

              This period poses challenges for individuals who lose their job, 
              as they may face difficulty in finding new employment due to their age or educational background not keeping 
              up with technological advancements. Consequently, the rate of job seekers in this age 
              group feeling discouraged has increased compared to the 90s.

              The current generation consists of individuals who were at least 30 years old during the Revolution, 
              and had to adjust to the new social norms while raising their children. 
              On the other hand, those who were in the same age group during the Revolution experienced democracy during their retirement years.
